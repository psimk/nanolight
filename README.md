## What it does

- **Finds apps as you type**: whole names, starts of words, initials (`ss` is System Settings), letters in order, and typos (`chorme` is Chrome). What you open often climbs.
- **Completes inline**: the rest of the top app's name, or of Google's top suggestion, is drawn faintly after the caret. Tab or → takes it; Return never does.
- **Does math**: `2^10 * 3` answers 3,072 (and `0xC00`). Return copies it.
- **Google suggestions**: up to four, under the apps, the words you add in bold. Nothing that reads as an address (a dot, a slash, an @) is sent.
- **Results in the panel**: Return on a search shows Google's page in the panel itself. Esc goes back to the list, ⌘↩ opens it in your browser, ⌘[ goes back a page.
- **Ask Grok, search X**, a row away.
- **⌘1–⌘9** run a row at once; ↑ ↓ and ⌃N ⌃P move.
- Lives in the menu bar: no Dock icon, and nothing drawn while it's idle.

## Sync across Macs (optional)

Off until you turn it on: choose **Sign In with Codegraff to Sync Across Macs…** in the menu bar icon's menu. Your browser opens codegraff.com to approve the sign-in, and from then on every Mac signed in to the same account shares:

- the key that opens Nanolight,
- whether Google suggestions are on,
- how often you open each app, so an empty panel suggests the same apps everywhere.

Two Macs merge rather than overwrite: the key and the suggestions setting follow whichever Mac changed them last, and each app keeps its higher count. Nothing else is sent: no queries, no history, no files. The sign-in key is kept in your Keychain, and **Sign Out of Codegraff** revokes it.

Syncing goes through your Codegraff account, so [Codegraff's terms](https://codegraff.com/terms) and [privacy policy](https://codegraff.com/privacy) apply to it. New accounts made by signing in from Nanolight get $2 of Codegraff credit.

## Install

Download `nanolight-macos-arm64.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/justrach/nanolight/releases/latest), open it and drag Nanolight to Applications. macOS 14 or later, Apple silicon.

On first run a short welcome picks the key that opens it (⌘Space, ⌥Space, ⌃Space, ⌥⌘Space or ⌘D) and says who else holds it: Spotlight gives up ⌘Space in System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Spotlight. To change the shortcut later, choose **Welcome…** from the menu bar icon's menu. Signed releases update themselves from this repository's releases; the menu bar icon offers the restart.

## Build

You need Zig 0.17.0 and Xcode or the Command Line Tools.

```sh
zig build test      # search, math, suggestions and the panel, through nanoui's Tester
zig build run       # build and open it
zig build app       # zig-out/Nanolight.app, for /Applications
VERSION=0.1.0 sh macos/package.sh   # the release: signed app, disk image, update zip, manifest.json
```

`macos/package.sh` signs with `$CODESIGN_IDENTITY` and notarizes when notary credentials are set (see the script); otherwise it signs ad hoc. Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds, signs and attaches the release.

## How it's made

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.zig` | The app: the window, the hot key, the menu bar icon, updates |
| `src/view.zig` | The panel: query, rows, footer, keys |
| `src/results.zig` | What a query lists, in order |
| `src/search.zig` | Fuzzy matching and ranking, allocation-free |
| `src/calc.zig` | The calculator |
| `src/suggest.zig` | Google's completions: the privacy guard, decoding, the cache (after [browse](https://github.com/justrach/browse)) |
| `src/preview.zig` | The results page in the panel (WKWebView) |
| `src/onboard.zig`, `src/shortcut.zig` | The welcome, and which key is free |
| `src/film.zig`, `src/stage.zig`, `tools/film.sh` | The walkthrough, rendered offscreen |
| `src/promo.zig`, `src/promo_cards.zig`, `tools/promo.sh`, `tools/promo/` | The promo: nanoui's shots, Blender's laptop ([docs/promo.md](docs/promo.md)) |

The icon is drawn by `tools/icon.py`. `src/backdrop.jpg` (the film's cover art) was made with OpenAI's image model.
